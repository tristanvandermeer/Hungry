( 25/11/25 - Just a note that this is done in a ton of files because I had just figured out that you can import files in the same dir so I went a little crazy with it )

Something to find all pdfs in the OCR website, and download them all. Just run linker.py for enumeration.

To do:

- ~~Change to include other filetypes (I keep missing .xlsx .doc(x) etc.)~~
- Fix search logic. Its not really a BFS. Poor for initial search.
- UI
- Perhaps some other QOL
