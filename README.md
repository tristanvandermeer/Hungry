Something to find all pdfs in the OCR website, and download them all. Just run linker.py for enumeration.

To do:

- Change to include other filetypes (I keep missing .xlsx .doc(x) etc.)
- Fix search logic. Its not really a BFS. Poor for initial search.
- I dunno how I feel about the UI
- Perhaps some other features, QOL
